It is a way to present her to potential casting directors, agents, and producers who might be interested in casting her as an actor in theatre, film or radio or hiring her as costume designer, assistant or maintanence for their projects. The site will be used by professionals in the Arts and Entertainment sector, producers, directors, heads or departments, costume department in particular. This site will act as a resume which employers will use to review relevant experience, achievements and qualifications.

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo, and the menu options: Home page, Actor page, Costume page, Gallery page and Contact page and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the menu options are hidden until a burger icon is clicked which then brings up the menu options.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Demo Reel__
    -  A video of Adrienne's demo reel would give prospective employers more insight into her abilities as an actress. 

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero image was chosen because is is eye-catching, with an obvious main focus on Adrienne. The dark colours of the blackbox theatre contrasts nicely with the soft colour palette of the site. The rest of the images used throughout the site are from a range of different shows. While the consistency between the images may vary, they are successful at visually showcasing Adrienne's experiences in acting and costume design.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The colour scheme was created by me based off of Adrienne's dress in the first image. It is subtle, but when viewed closely, there are green leaves on her dress which inspired the colours used throughout the site.

        ![Colour Palette](/readme/documentation/supp-images/color-palette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Oxygen font into styles.css.  It was chosen as it is a simple, font with a strong clear feel that doesn't distract from the content.

- All external links (social icons) open up a new browser tab that routes the user to the relevant page
test repeated for each social link on each subsequent page
- Contact form prevents user from submitting empty
upon submission, contact form gives user feedback of successful submission.
