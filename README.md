# ADRIENNE WALSH


## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.




<h1 align="center">Adrienne Walsh Website</h1>

[View the live project here](https://maryclaireteahan.github.io/adriennewalsh/)


Adrienne Walsh is a site that showcases Adrienne's acting and costume design skills, experience, and achievements. It is a way to present her to potential casting directors, agents, and producers who might be interested in casting her as an actor in theatre, film or radio or hiring her as costume designer, assistant or maintanence for their projects.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Demo Reel__
    -  A video of Adrienne's demo reel would give prospective employers more insight into her abilities as an actress. 

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero image was chosen because is is eye-catching, with an obvious main focus on Adrienne. The dark colours of the blackbox theatre contrasts nicely with the soft colour palette of the site. The rest of the images used throughout the site are from a range of different shows. While the consistency between the images may vary, they are successful at visually showcasing Adrienne's experiences in acting and costume design.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The colour scheme was created by me based off of Adrienne's dress in the first image. It is subtle, but when viewed closely, there are green leaves on her dress which inspired the colours used throughout the site.

        ![Colour Palette](/readme/documentation/supp-images/color-palette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Oxygen font into styles.css.  It was chosen as it is a simple, font with a strong clear feel that doesn't distract from the content.
