# Adrienne Walsh

In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience. 

For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club. 

Adrienne Walsh is a site that showcases Adrienne's acting and costume design skills, experience, and achievements. It is a way to present her to potential casting directors, agents, and producers who might be interested in casting her as an actor in theatre, film or radio or hiring her as costume designer, assitant or maintanence for their projects.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html 


## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content 

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
- The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site


Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer! 

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process! 



<h1 align="center">Adrienne Walsh Website</h1>

[View the live project here](https://maryclaireteahan.github.io/adriennewalsh/)

THRIVE Juices and Smoothies is a site that advertises a fictional refreshment business.  The business primarily sells juices and smoothies and also a limited range of healthy snacks and hot beverages.  The site is targeted toward people who want to buy healthy refreshments "on the go" - the business also has a seating area for anyone who wants to stay and socialise but its primary USP is the appeal, taste and quality of the products.  The site will be useful for people who want to check out the range of products available, the location and opening hours of the business.
Adrienne Walsh is a site that showcases Adrienne's acting and costume design skills, experience, and achievements. It is a way to present her to potential casting directors, agents, and producers who might be interested in casting her as an actor in theatre, film or radio or hiring her as costume designer, assistant or maintanence for their projects.

## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Menu and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.

      ![Navbar](documentation/supp-images/f01-nav-bar.png)
    

-   __F02 Landing Page image and call to action__

    - The landing area includes a photograph and a text overlay that together clearly identify the purpose of the business and the type of product it sells.  The citrus colours and 'welcome' message are intended to be appealing to the user and convey a sense of health, freshness and friendliness.

    - A large bright "See Our Menu" button is placed central to the screen as an eye-catching call to action which gives the user an obvious quick route to the menu page.

      ![Landing Area](documentation/supp-images/f02-landing.png)

- __F03 Tagline__

    - The "enjoy here or takeaway - the choice is yours" tagline appears on the main page and again on the menu page to let the user know that seating is available and to help re-inforce consistency in branding.

      ![Tagline](documentation/supp-images/f03-tagline.png)

- __F04 Company Ideals section__

    - The company ideals are presented using 4 flip cards below the tagline on the main page.  These cards give the user more information about the organisation in relation to its strategy in the areas of quality, sourcing of ingredients, recycling and philanthropy.
    
      ![Company Ideals](documentation/supp-images/f04-company-ideals.png)

- __F05 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains three sections :

        - Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer on each page allows the user to quickly and easily find this information, this is important for this type of business as it is information that the user needs in order to make use of the company (product is sold offline).

        - Address - similar to the opening times, the address of this type of business is important to the user in order for them to use the company and so has been repeated on each page in the footer to allow the user to quickly and easily find out where the company is located 

        - Stay in Touch - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As THRIVE is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

      ![Footer](documentation/supp-images/f05-footer.png)

- __F06 Menu Page - 'Carte' section__

    - The menu page gives a list of the products that can be purchased at THRIVE.  For ease of use and clarity for the user the products have been split into three panels, one for 'Fresh Juices', one for 'Smoothies', and the third for 'Healthy Snacks and Hot Drinks'.  Pricing and ingredients are also shown.
    
    - For ease of use, a consistent look and feel is maintained through the use of the same background image as is used for the landing image on the main page, and in applying the same background colour to the menu panels as is used on the overlay text area on the main page.  Text colour is kept simple for readability and to minimise distraction.

       ![Menu Page](documentation/supp-images/f06-menu.png)


- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

    - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message.  By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email.  Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)

      ![Contact Us](documentation/supp-images/f07-contact-us.png)

- __F08 Contact Page - 'How to Find Us'__

    - The 'How to Find Us' panel of the Contact page gives the user an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address, phone number and administration email address in large font to make it easily readable.  By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation.

      ![Find Us](documentation/supp-images/f08-find-us.png)


- __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document are numbered and categorised into groups A (first time visitor), B (returning visitor) and C (frequent visitor).  The existing features are listed above as F01 to F08.  Below is a traceability matrix cross-referencing the user stories with the features, illustrating which features support which stories :

    ![User Story Feature Matrix](documentation/supp-images/us-feat-matrix.png)

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Company Timeline__
    - A 'Company Timeline' page could be added to provide more information on the evolution of the business for users who would like to know more about the origins of the company, its ethos and its involvement with the community.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The functionality of the navigation bar could be extended to make it "sticky" so that it would be available to the user without scrolling.
    - A hamburger menu could be implemented to save space on smaller screens.

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help keep the site clear and easy to use.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A citrus/pastel palette was chosen to convey a fresh, energetic mood.  The colours picked were inspired by a palette from [Lily Bug Design](https://www.lilybugdesign.co.nz/colour-wall)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/citruspalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Oswald fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.


-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### Main Page Wireframes

        ![Main](documentation/wireframes/index-page.png)

    -   #### Menu Page Wireframes

        ![Menu](documentation/wireframes/menu-page.png)

    -   #### Contact Page Wireframes

        ![Contact](documentation/wireframes/contact-page.png)

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
